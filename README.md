# Start ðŸŽ’
This is what I use to start my web applications. It's a fairly simple Webpack project structure that can be easily extended and personalized. Simplicity is the goal. Just plug your view library into the configs and build something.

#### Start development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

**_Note:_** This will start a local server and you'll see some message from `webpack-dev-server` that it was started on `yourIp:somePort`. That's OK. You can access it using your `localhost:port`. I did that in order to use the development server with other devices in the same network. If you don't like it, just change the dev server configurations.

#### Build:

```bash
npm run build
```
